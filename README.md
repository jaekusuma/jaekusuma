## Summary
### Hi There üëã, I'm Jaelani Kusuma!

In December 2022, I completed Alterra Academy's immersion program and became a Quality Assurance Engineer. I gained knowledge of manual and automated testing utilizing Java, SerenityBDD, Cucumber, Maven, Rest Assured, and Gherkin for mobile, web, and APIs. JMeter was used by me for performance testing as well. I use Trello as our primary team management tool when working on projects for immersive programs with the Scrum process.
